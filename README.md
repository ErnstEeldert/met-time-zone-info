# SFS Mobile Extension - Time Zone Information

This is a small extension that leverages LWC base components (OSS) and SLDS in combination with the Salesforce Field Service Mobile Extension Toolkit (BETA). It displays the time zone as defined on the user record as well as on the user's device. It also allows the user to update the user record with the device time zone, if different.
